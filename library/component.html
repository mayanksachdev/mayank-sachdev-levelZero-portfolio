    <h1>component library</h1>
    <p> I am currently attending <strong>neog.camp</strong> and learning basics of HTML, CSS and javascript from the
        levelZero playlist.</p>
    <p>I am creating this component library to better design each element.</p>
    <p>after completing this library I am going to use this library for my <strong>portfolio, blogs and
            projects.</strong>This will ensure all my levelZero projects have <strong>consistent themeing and
            styling</strong>.</p>

    <h2>@typography</h2>
    <h1>this is the main and biggest heading of a webpage</h1>
    <h2>this is second biggest heading </h2>
    <p>This is normal text. Long running text would look like this on my website. This will auto fold based on the
        width of webpage.</p>
    <p class="">This is relatively smaller text.</p>

    <div class="container">
        Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a
        galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also
        the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the
        release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software
        like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
